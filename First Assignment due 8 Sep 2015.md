**Assignment 1**

1.Team Name(selection)

2.Team Logo(selection)

3.Team Organization(selection)

4.Meet Customer 4 Sep 2015 Friday : Ms.Wuthrich Cerise

5.Process Model (selection)

__Process Activities__

1.Software specification

2.Software design and implementation

3.Software validation

4.Software evolution

__Software Process__

A structured set of activities required to develop a software system

1.Specification, 
2.Design,
3.Validation, 
4.Evolution.


**Software Process Model:**

A software process model is an abstract representation of a process.

It presents a description of a process from some particular perspective.

Process should be:

**Visible**: Activities should provide clear indications of progress (deadlines/milestones)

**Understandable**: Activities and their order of execution are well-defined

**Supportable**: Automated support for activities is available

**Usable**: Process is acceptable to and usable by developers

__WaterFall Model__

--The main drawback of the waterfall model is the difficulty of accommodating change.

__Variant Model__

**V-shaped model**: relationship between types of tests and phases before testing

Prototyping variant: requirements and design prototypes

__Evolutionary Develoment__

**Exploratory development**

Objective is to work with customers and to evolve a final system from an initial outline specification. 

Should start with well-understood requirements and add new features as proposed by the customer.

__Throw-away prototyping__

Objective is to understand the system requirements. 

Should start with poorly understood requirements to clarify what is really needed.  

Good for conceptual development.

__PrototypingProcess Model__

Process: quick design, build prototype, evaluate, refine prototype, â€¦ engineer product

__Process iteration__

System requirements ALWAYS evolve in the course of a project so process iteration 

where earlier stages are reworked is always part of the process for large systems.

Iteration can be applied to any of the generic process models.

__Two (related) approaches__

1.Incremental delivery;

2.Spiral development

__Incremental Model__
